# Peruvian Potato Virome (PPV)

it is a project of the International Potato Center [CIP](https://cipotato.org/) in collaboration with Dr. Kreuze at **CIP** & Dr. [Garrett](https://www.garrettlab.com/) and [I](https://ricardoi.github.io/) from the department of [Plant Pathology](https://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/), Emerginc Pathogens Institute [EPI](https://epi.ufl.edu/) and Food Systems Institute [FSI](https://foodsystems.ifas.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida.

## Peruvian Potatato Sampling
Around ~900 samples of potato from the main production regions of potato was analyzed using Virome Network Analysis [ViNA] and species distribution and disease ecology modeling. 

## Virome dataset for the peruvian potato virome
The dataset of the Peruvian Potato Virome is organized in a webpage which includes photos (from field, plants, and collected leaves), field information, and molecular information (genome sequences) of the detected and identified viruses (known and unknown) which are necessary to better understand the diversity and distribution of viruses and their correlation with potato production in Peru. It is a basic line to monitoring changes of viral populations and the risk they represent for potato cultivation under a global warm. Link: http://potpathodiv.org/
